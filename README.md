# React Markdown Wysiwyg Editor (ReMaWy)
This project is currently work in progress. Please do not use it.

## Using the test-app while development
Dont forget zu execute 
```
npm link test-app/node_modules/react
```
from the root folder. This prevents the test-app from using a second version of react, that would cause invalid hook call errors.
